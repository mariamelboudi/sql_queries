## 1. Data Exploration and Basic Aggregation
Challenge: Explore a dataset of sales transactions (e.g., for a fictional retail store). Calculate total sales, average sales per transaction, and identify the top-selling products.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Basic aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), filtering (WHERE), grouping (GROUP BY), and sorting (ORDER BY).

## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Challenge: Work with a messy dataset (e.g., customer information) that includes NULL values, inconsistent naming, or redundant rows. Clean the data by removing duplicates, filling in or handling missing values, and standardizing formatting.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning techniques (IS NULL, COALESCE, DISTINCT, TRIM, LOWER), filtering, and data transformation.

## 3. Customer Segmentation
Challenge: Use a dataset of customer purchases to create different customer segments based on purchase frequency, average spend, or other behaviors.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK), conditional aggregation with CASE, and segmentation logic.

## 4. Cohort Analysis
Challenge: Using user data, analyze retention by creating monthly cohorts and calculating retention rates for each cohort over time.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Date manipulation functions, JOINs on date-related fields, and cohort retention calculations using COUNT and GROUP BY.

## 5. Churn Analysis
Challenge: Analyze customer churn by identifying customers who haven’t made a purchase within a specific timeframe. Calculate the churn rate month-over-month.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Subqueries, date functions, conditional aggregations, and building a time-based metric like churn rate.

## 6. AB Testing Analysis
Challenge: Given an A/B test dataset with experiment and control groups, calculate metrics like average spend or conversion rate for each group, and determine if the difference is statistically significant.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Filtering with CASE statements, joins, aggregation for groups, and understanding statistical significance (could include a hypothesis test if familiar with SQL extensions or additional software).

## 7. Time Series Analysis
Challenge: Analyze trends over time in a dataset, such as daily or weekly sales, and detect seasonality patterns (e.g., sales by day of the week or month).
##### Skills Demonstrated: Time-based aggregation, DATE_TRUNC, EXTRACT, window functions for moving averages, and calculating growth rates.

## 8. Inventory Management
Challenge: Track inventory levels for a product dataset. Calculate the current stock level for each product, factoring in sales, restocking events, and any damaged or returned items.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Cumulative sums with window functions, conditional statements, joins, and inventory tracking calculations.

## 9. Employee Productivity Analysis
Challenge: Given a dataset with employee tasks and hours worked, calculate key metrics such as average task completion time, employee utilization rate, and identify the top-performing employees.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Window functions, conditional aggregation, and handling nested subqueries.

## 10. Building a Data Model with SQL
Challenge: Create a simplified relational model for a fictional company’s database, designing tables for Customers, Orders, Products, and Employees, and setting up relationships between them.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Database design, creating tables, defining primary and foreign keys, setting up indexes, and creating relationships.
Advanced Challenges

## 11. Building a Recommendation System
Challenge: Based on user purchase history, create a basic recommendation system that suggests products frequently bought together or products similar to those a user has bought.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Advanced joins, correlation calculations, co-occurrence matrix, and collaborative filtering.

## 12. Recursive Queries for Hierarchical Data
Challenge: Using a table with hierarchical data (e.g., employee management structure or product categories), write a recursive query to identify all subordinates of a given employee or sub-categories of a category.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Recursive CTEs, handling hierarchical data, and organizing nested structures.

## 13. Fraud Detection
Challenge: Identify potential fraud cases within a transactions dataset by looking for patterns such as unusually large purchases, transactions in quick succession, or transactions from unexpected locations.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and combining CASE, window functions, and aggregate functions for fraud metrics.

## 14. Event Funnel Analysis
Challenge: Given a dataset with a sequence of user events, perform funnel analysis to see the percentage of users that progress from one step to the next (e.g., from product view to checkout to purchase).
##### Skills Demonstrated: Sequential event analysis, using ROW_NUMBER or LAG/LEAD, window functions, and calculating conversion rates between steps.

## 15. Data Pipeline Automation (Stored Procedures and Triggers)
Challenge: Create a stored procedure that automatically cleans and aggregates data from a raw data table into a clean, structured table, or implement a trigger that logs changes to a critical table.
##### Skills Demonstrated: Stored procedures, triggers, and basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts.
