<br> [2] Who is the oldest customer ? The youngest ? What is the age span ? What is the average age ? What is the most common birth year ? How does the customer age vary ? Can we define age groups ?
<br> [3] What are the different levels of education ? How is this distributed amongst them ?
<br> [4] Same for marital status ?
<br> [5] What is the highest income ? The lowest ? The span ? How does the income vary ? What is the highest income for each marital status ? For each education level ? How does the income span for each education level ? For each marital status ?
