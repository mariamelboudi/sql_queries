Here are some key considerations you should take into account to address this issue:

1. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
Onboarding experience: The initial experience of the game is critical. If the onboarding (tutorials, guides, or initial gameplay) is too long, complicated, or confusing, players might get frustrated and leave.
Make onboarding intuitive: Ensure that players understand how to play quickly and enjoy the game right away.
Game design and flow: If the interface is not intuitive or if the navigation is confusing, players might find it hard to engage.
Simplify the UI: Reduce clutter, and make sure the controls, menus, and interactions are easy to understand.
First impression: The visuals, sounds, and overall feel of the game should immediately capture the player's interest. Is the game visually appealing and engaging in the first 5 minutes?
2. Game Content and Core Gameplay
Engagement and fun factor: The early levels or tasks in the game need to be fun and rewarding. If the core gameplay loop (e.g., the main activities or challenges) doesn’t grab the player’s attention or feels repetitive, they are likely to quit.
Test early gameplay: Ensure that the game is fun right from the start and builds excitement gradually.
Challenge vs. reward balance: If the game is too hard or too easy, players may leave because they don't find it enjoyable or rewarding.
Balance difficulty: Gradually increase the challenge and ensure that rewards feel meaningful to keep players motivated.
3. Monetization and Ads
Paywalls and microtransactions: If players are bombarded with too many paywalls or pressured to spend money too early, it can push them away.
Don’t over-monetize early: Delay aggressive monetization efforts to give players time to get invested in the game first.
Ads: Excessive or intrusive ads can drive players away, especially in early stages.
Balance ads: Use ads sparingly, particularly in the first-time player experience. Consider offering rewards for watching ads instead of forcing them.
4. Technical Issues
Performance: If the game crashes, has bugs, or has long load times, this will frustrate players and lead to abandonment.
Optimize performance: Ensure that the game runs smoothly, especially on the most common devices players use.
Compatibility: If the game doesn’t perform well on a range of devices (low-end and high-end), you could be losing players from various segments.
5. Player Motivation and Retention Mechanics
Progression and rewards: Players need to feel like they're making progress and being rewarded for their efforts, even in the early stages.
Create a strong progression system: Offer visible goals (like levels, achievements, or unlocks) to motivate players to keep playing.
Social features: Games with social elements (e.g., leaderboards, multiplayer modes, or sharing features) often see higher retention as players feel connected to a community.
Add social engagement: Encourage players to connect with friends or participate in social features that boost engagement.
6. Competition and Player Expectations
Competition in the market: Players may be comparing your game to similar games they have played. If your game doesn't stand out or meet their expectations, they may move on.
Analyze competitor games: Understand what successful games in your genre are doing right, and evaluate how your game compares.
Expectations vs. delivery: If the game's description or marketing sets unrealistic expectations, players may feel disappointed when the actual experience doesn’t match.
Ensure consistency: Make sure your marketing aligns with the real gameplay experience so players don’t feel misled.
7. Feedback and Iteration
User feedback: Gather feedback from the players who quit. Use surveys, reviews, or analytics tools to understand why they left.
Iterate on feedback: Continuously improve the game based on player feedback, focusing on common pain points like difficulty, clarity, or rewards.
Next Steps:
Analyze metrics: Use data analytics to track where most players drop off (e.g., right after downloading, after the first level, or after seeing an ad). This will help you target the exact problem area.
A/B testing: Run experiments on different game features, onboarding flows, or UI layouts to see what retains players better.
By focusing on these areas, you can identify and fix the reasons why players aren’t returning, helping to improve your retention rates and overall game success.
