When a name seems to be a mix of the previous and the following row.

Inspecting the unit price should help.
However, in this case it does not.

Encountered 'polkadot' and 'retrospot' multiple times. Now I understand that one is being used for the other.
Will standardise in the futur.

Checking the nearest rows reveals further poor data entry

Here the names are a bit suprising. A few rows down there is a name that seems more standardised and representative.

Alternatively, I could have calculated the total impact of this poor data on the whole dataset and dropped it all together if it represented a reasonable amount of loss

ADVICE
- standardise stock codes
- standardise dscription
- separate colours in a different column
